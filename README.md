A community-driven Sketch series to build a Design System. Visit us at http://meetup.com/sketch-305/

## Part 1 - What a great turn out!
Thanks everyone for showing up to our first meetup! We had an outstanding turn out, and the Fajitas were delicious.

### Sketch Introduction
We reviewed the Sketch interface and created a simple button with label.

### Symbols

When creating symbols, ensure your __layers are properly named__ and on the proper top-down order, as this order dictates the way they are displayed in the override inspector panel.

### Libraries
Libraries allow you to __share symbols__ across othe Sketch files. This is very helpful when you have to build a number of screens and share your files with other team members.

In Part-2 we will show you how to collaborate your library files on the cloud.

## Pro Tips
The following are some of the handy tips and shortcuts mentioned during the Part-1 workshop:

##### Naming Layers
- Get in the habit of __always__ renaming layers right after you create them.
- Keep your __files clean__ and well organized - take the time to do that!
- Your Sketch files are an important part of your __portfolio__ and it is the best way to differentiate yourself from other team members.  
- When creating or renaming symbols, use `/` to build your symbol menu structure. (ie: `forms/buttons/button-rounded`)

##### Must learn keyboard shortcuts:
 - __Cmd+2__ : Zoom to selection
 - __Cmd+1__ : Zoom out
 - __R__ : Rectangle
 - __A__ : New Artboard
 - __Ctrl+C__ : Color picker (the winner!)

##### Removing the grey border forever from new shapes.
1. Draw a new shape
2. Remove the dark grey border
3. From the menu, go to Layer > Style > __Set as Default Style__
4. Voil√°!
